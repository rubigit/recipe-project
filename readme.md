## Aditional note:
Owing that I have a visual condition, I have to do a really good zoom. So, to be able to see my code, I instaled an extension that wrap all the lines. For that reason the lines of my code have many breaks like the following example: 
<p>Lorem ipsum, dolor 
     sit amet consectetur
			adipisicing 
            elit.
			Quam nemo explicabo
			blanditlat?</p>
